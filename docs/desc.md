# Data Collection and Preprocessing

Curate a representative dataset of handwritten equations with aligned LaTeX ground truth. Perform image normalization, augmentation, and annotation.

Model Design: Architect a neural network combining an encoder (e.g., CNN to extract visual features) and a decoder (e.g., attention-based RNN or Transformer) to generate symbol sequences in LaTeX syntax.

Training Strategy: Define a suitable loss function (e.g., cross-entropy over symbol vocabulary), batch strategy, and hyperparameter optimization process. Leverage techniques like curriculum learning or teacher forcing to improve convergence.

Evaluation Metrics: Measure performance with sequence accuracy, symbol-level edit distance, and structural correctness of rendered equations (visual comparison with ground truth).

User Interface Prototype: Build a simple interface (web or desktop) where users can upload equation images and receive editable LaTeX code.

## Scope and Deliverables

Literature Survey: Summarize existing methods in mathematical OCR and sequence-to-sequence modeling.

Dataset Preparation: Handwritten formula collection (e.g., CROHME dataset) plus custom samples; preprocessing scripts.

Model Implementation: Training scripts, model checkpoints, inference pipeline.

Evaluation Report: Detailed analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and comparison to baseline.

Demo Application: Prototype UI with upload, preview, and LaTeX output.

Documentation: README, usage guide, and code comments for reproducibility.

## Methodology Overview

Data Pipeline:

Acquire datasets (e.g., CROHME challenge data).

Convert ground-truth XML annotations to plain LaTeX sequences.

Apply image augmentations: rotation, scaling, elastic distortions.

Model Architecture:

Encoder: Deep CNN (e.g., ResNet-based) to extract a sequence of feature vectors across image width.

Decoder: Transformer or attention-based LSTM that predicts LaTeX tokens one at a time.

Attention Mechanism: Align decoder steps to encoder feature locations for accurate symbol placement.

Training:

Use teacher forcing initially; gradually switch to reinforcement of modelâ€™s own predictions.

Optimize with Adam or AdamW; apply learning-rate scheduling.

Implement checkpointing and early stopping based on validation loss.

Inference & Postprocessing:

Beam search decoding to improve sequence quality.

Syntax validation and error-correction heuristics (e.g., matching braces).

Evaluation:

Compute metric scores on held-out test set.

Visualize rendered LaTeX outputs alongside original images for qualitative analysis.
